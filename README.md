# CQRS using MediatR

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

CQRS is a way to separate how we read and write data in an application. It divides data operations into two types:

* Queries: These are read-only operations that retrieve data without changing it.
* Commands: These are operations that make changes to the data, such as creating, updating, or deleting it.

This separation helps make large applications more manageable, easier to test, and scalable. It also allows us to optimize read and write operations separately, which can improve performance. However, for simple applications with basic data access needs, CQRS might add unnecessary complexity.

#### Benefits of CQRS

* Scalability: CQRS makes it easy to scale the read and write parts of the application separately, which improves performance.
* Faster Queries: By optimizing the read model, you can make queries faster and more efficient.
* Better Security: CQRS allows you to apply different security measures to the read and write parts, making it harder for unauthorized changes to happen.
* Event Sourcing: CQRS works well with Event Sourcing, which helps track all changes to the application and provides a detailed history.

#### When to Use CQRS

* Complex Queries: When your application has complex queries that need to be optimized for performance.
* Scalability Issues: When the read and write loads are very different and need to be scaled separately.
* Audit Trails: When you need to keep a detailed record of all changes to the application.
* Security Requirements: When your application has strict security requirements and needs different levels of access control for read and write operations.


### Mediator Pattern

The Mediator pattern helps manage how objects interact with each other. Instead of objects talking directly to each other, they communicate through a mediator. This way, the objects don't need to know about each other, which makes them less dependent on each other.

For example, a service sends its request to the mediator, and the mediator then passes it on to the appropriate request handler for processing.

The Mediator pattern is useful for implementing CQRS. Commands and queries are sent to the mediator, which then maps them to their respective handlers. This separation helps make the system more modular and easier to manage.

#### Benefits of MediatR

* Less Coupling: MediatR helps keep different parts of your application separate, making it easier to maintain and change.
* Cleaner Code: MediatR encourages you to keep different tasks in separate classes, making your code more organized and modular.
* Reusable Logic: MediatR allows you to add features like logging, validation, or caching to multiple request handlers in a consistent way.
* Easy Extensions: MediatR is flexible and can be easily extended to handle different types of requests and work with other libraries and frameworks.

#### When to Use MediatR

* Reduce Coupling: When you want to make your application more flexible and easier to maintain by reducing tight connections between different parts.
* Modular Code: When you want to keep your code organized and modular by separating different tasks into separate classes.
* Shared Features: When you want to add features like logging, validation, or caching to multiple parts of your application in a consistent way.
